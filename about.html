  <h2> ABOUT </h2>
  <p> Natasha is a 22 year old recent graduate from New York University with a degree in Anthropology and a focus on food culture and gender and sexuality studies. Born in Los Angeles, California, Natasha has also lived in her mother's native country, Colombia, as well as France, Argentina, and Indonesia. She began cooking at just 4 years old by helping her dad make pancakes on Saturday mornings. Since then she has gone on to work in various positions in the food industry: from catering private events to producing and publishing a podcast series on the underground food culture in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Natasha most recently published a senior research thesis exploring the intersectionality of food and gender identity, observing how celebrity chefs in America reproduce their gender identities through specific food practices both in front of and behind the camera. Now she plans to travel the world collecting stories and recipes from the people she meets and the places she goes. </p>
